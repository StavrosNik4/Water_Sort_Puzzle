# Water Sort Puzzle Solver

A Water Sort Puzzle Solver implemented with C++ using the BFS seach algorithm.

## Problem Îœodeling

I used 2 classes to implement the solver:
<li>Tube</li>
<li>Game</li>

### Tube

This class is used for representation of the Tubes and their contents.
It consists of 2 private and 10 public fields.

*Private:*
<li>An char array `st` with size 4 which contains the contents for each Tube. Each color is represented with a specific char character</li>
<li>An int index `size` for the size of the current content</li>

*Public:*
<li></li>
<li></li>
